<h1 align="center">Game List - Fullstack Project</h1>

# üìç Overview

## üéØ Goal

Development of a complete game registration, listing and management system that allows users to add games with their respective categories (e.g. Action, Adventure, RPG) and platforms (e.g. PC, PS5, Xbox).

The system provides a robust and secure backend API with authentication, data validation, filtering, sorting and pagination, which serves as the basis for a game registration page. On the front end, it delivers a complete, responsive and well-structured application with validations, context management and component-based architecture.
